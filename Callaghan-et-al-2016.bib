Selection of coarse clean substrate appears to be of primary importance for successful reproduction. Spawning sites are expected to occur in areas of high currents or wave energy with low paniculate accumulation rates. In most lakes, such sites are usually shallow areas along windswept shores. A variety of behavioral stimuli and cues (e.g., chemosensory cues, memory of site, kin recognition) also have the potential of influencing spawning site selection and may ultimately contribute to sympatric stock separation. Overall, the species appears to be rather adaptable and able to colonize new environments that satisfy basic habitat requirements. Behavioral abnormalities do not appear to be responsible for difficulties in reestablishing reproducing populations of lake trout in the lower Great Lakes.},

  abstract = {The Mid-Lake Reef Complex (MLRC), a large area of deep (\&gt; 40 m) reefs, was a major site where indigenous lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) in Lake Michigan aggregated during spawning. As part of an effort to restore Lake Michigan's lake trout, which were extirpated in the 1950s, yearling lake trout have been released over the MLRC since the mid-1980s and fall gill net censuses began to show large numbers of lake trout in spawning condition beginning about 1999. We report the first evidence of viable egg deposition and successful lake trout fry production at these deep reefs. Because the area's existing bathymetry and habitat were too poorly known for a priori selection of sampling sites, we used hydroacoustics to locate concentrations of large fish in the fall; fish were congregating around slopes and ridges. Subsequent observations via unmanned submersible confirmed the large fish to be lake trout. Our technological objectives were driven by biological objectives of locating where lake trout spawn, where lake trout fry were produced, and what fishes ate lake trout eggs and fry. The unmanned submersibles were equipped with a suction sampler and electroshocker to sample eggs deposited on the reef, draw out and occasionally catch emergent fry, and collect egg predators (slimy sculpin Cottus cognatus). We observed slimy sculpin to eat unusually high numbers of lake trout eggs. Our qualitative approaches are a first step toward quantitative assessments of the importance of lake trout spawning on the MLRC.},

  abstract = {Bright colors, enlarged fins, feather plumes, song, horns, antlers, and tusks are often highly sex dimorphic. Why have males in many animals evolved more conspicuous ornaments, signals, and weapons than females? How can such traits evolve although they may reduce male survival? Such questions prompted Darwin's perhaps most scientifically controversial idea--the theory of sexual selection. It still challenges researchers today as they try to understand how competition for mates can favor the variety of sex-dimorphic traits. Reviewing theoretical and empirical work in this very active field, Malte Andersson, a leading contributor himself, provides a major up-to-date synthesis of sexual selection. The author describes the theory and its recent development; examines models, methods, and empirical tests; and identifies many unsolved problems. Among the topics discussed are the selection and evolution of mating preferences; relations between sexual selection and speciation; constraints on sexual selection; and sex differences in signals, body size, and weapons. The rapidly growing study of sexual selection in plants is also reviewed. This volume will interest students, teachers, and researchers in behavioral ecology and evolutionary biology.},

The evolution and proximate control of these alternatives are only beginning to be understood. Although game theory has provided a theoretical framework, the concept of the mixed strategy has not been realized in nature, and alternative strategies are very rare. Recent findings suggest that almost all alternative reproductive phenotypes within the sexes are due to alternative tactics within a conditional strategy, and, as such, while the average fitnesses of the alternative phenotypes are unequal, the strategy is favoured in evolution. Proximate mechanisms that underlie alternative phenotypes may have many similarities with those operating between the sexes.},

Reproductive traits of females have been shaped principally by natural selection for offspring production and survival, those of males by sexual selection for access to matings. Female Atlantic salmon invest approximately six times more energy in offspring production (i.e. gonads) than males and face an important trade-off between number and size of eggs to produce that will maximize the number of surviving offspring. Timing of breeding and the construction of nests appear adapted to increase offspring survival. The most important determinant of female breeding success is body size because it affords high fecundity, access to breeding territories and decreased probability of nest destruction. Asynchronous female spawning and the male ability to spawn rapidly and repeatedly results in male-biased operational sex ratios that generate intense male competition for mates. This has likely been responsible for the evolution of elaborate male secondary sexual characters associated with fighting and status signalling. Furthermore, it has given rise, through frequency-dependent selection, to two alternative male breeding phenotypes: (1) large, anadromous males; and (2) small, mature male parr. Anadromous males invest heavily in behavioural activity on the spawning grounds, searching and fighting for mates and courting them, with body size being an important determinant of their breeding success. This behavioural activity carries a heavy cost, as anadromous males have significantly reduced survival relative to females. In contrast, mature male parr invest proportionally more in testes for sperm competition and attempt to `sneak' access to matings. While this behaviour also carries costs in terms of subsequent growth and survival, male parr are more likely to breed again, either prior to or following a migration to sea, than anadromous males. While knowledge about the breeding of Atlantic salmon is detailed, we are only beginning to understand the ultimate causes and/or functional significances of their reproductive strategies. Predictive models of the life history variation are developing, focusing on the need for empirical study and testing of life history and reproductive patterns.},

  abstract = {In the breeding system of Pacific salmon, females compete for oviposition territories, and males compete to fertilize eggs. The natural selection in females and sexual selection in males likely has been responsible for their elaborate breeding morphologies and the dimorphism between the sexes. We quantified direct-selection intensities during breeding on mature coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), measured for seven phenotypic characters, including three secondary sexual characters. Wild and sea-ranched hatchery coho were used to enhance the range of phenotypes over which selection could be examined. The fish were allowed to breed in experimental arenas where we could quantify components of breeding success as well as estimate overall breeding success. We found that without competition, natural selection acts only on female body size for increased egg production; there is no detectable selection on males for the phenotypic distribution we used. Under competition, the opportunity for selection increased sixfold among females. Natural selection favored female body size and caudal-peduncle (tail) depth. Increased body size meant increased egg production and access to nesting territories. The caudal peduncle, used in burst swimming and nest digging, influenced both successful egg deposition and nest survival. Increasing density increased competition among females, though it did not significantly intensify natural selection on their characters. In males, competition increased the opportunity for selection 52-fold, which was nine times greater than for females. Sexual selection favored male body size and hooked snout length, both characters directly influencing male access to spawning opportunities. Selection on male body size was also affected significantly by breeding density. The ability of large males to control access to spawning females decreased at higher densities reflecting an increase in the operational sex ratio. Further, the relative success of small males, which could sneak access to spawning females, appeared to increase as that of intermediate-sized males decreased. Such disruptive selection may be responsible for the evolution of alternative reproductive tactics in salmon.},

We inferred reproductive strategies adopted by both sexes by applying a maximum likelihood method to determine parent-offspring genotype relationships. A high degree of variance in individual reproductive success for both males and females was revealed. The high number of mates used by both sexes is not concordant with previous behavioral studies proposing that females are mainly monogamous in this species. We found little evidence supporting the prediction from previous reports of a positive relationship between individual size and realized reproductive success for either males or females. For both sexes, however, there was a significant correlation between the number of mates and the number of offspring. These results indicate that this species' mating system is more flexible than previously thought and suggest that factors such as potential genetic benefits or environmental uncertainty may also be driving the evolution and the plasticity of mating systems in Atlantic salmon.},

  abstract = {1. The movements and breeding behaviour of male coho salmon in Kanaka Creek, British Columbia, Canada, were studied by means of radio-telemetry and detailed observations of males in breeding groups. 2. Males were of three morphological types, large, three year old males (which we term alpha males), small, three year old males (which we term satellite males) and small, two year old 'jack' males (which we term sneak males). All three types of male were common in the population. 3. Males associated with females in breeding groups that included one alpha male and one or more of the two smaller male types. Alpha males dominated in breeding groups. Their movements tended to be restricted to a small section of the spawning stream where they had primary access to redd building females. 4. The majority of aggressive interactions were between resident alpha males and intruding large males, which the resident attempted to drive away. Alpha males would not tolerate another large male nearby and would attack until the intruder left the area. Aggressive interactions between alpha and satellite males or between alpha and sneak males were much less frequent. The alpha males moved from female to female within their section of stream, often returning several times to the same female over the space of a few days. 5. Satellite males adopted positions downstream from a breeding pair. Satellite males were highly mobile within the stream and were observed to join breeding groups at widely spaced locations without significant aggressive interaction with the alpha male. An established satellite male would oppose but not drive away other satellite males attempting to join the breeding group, allowing them to adopt subordinate positions further downstream. The first satellite male in a breeding group would also defend and court the female during periods when the alpha male was absent. 6. Sneak males were most often observed in the spawning redd with the alpha male and female. Sneak males were also found hiding outside the redd early in redd construction, when the cavity of the redd was still shallow, or if the sneak was larger than 30 cm. Sneak males were subject to little aggression from the alpha male or satellite males and displayed the lowest frequency of aggressive interactions of the three types of male. Sneak males would defend their position against other sneak males. Like alpha males, sneak males restricted their movements to a small section of the spawning stream. 7. Overall levels of aggression were lowest in breeding groups consisting of two or three males and much higher in groups consisting of just the alpha male or of four or more males. Intrusion by a large male that challenged the alpha increased the rate of aggressive interaction among all members of the group. 8. Our results suggest three unique breeding tactics among coho males, here termed alpha, satellite and sneak. On the basis of the information currently available, it cannot be determined whether the choice of tactic by a particular male is genetically determined, environmentally determined, or both.},

This selection pressure was caused by the dominance hierarchy within parr and may have been facilitated by indifference of dominant migratory males to parr. Unlike the secondary sexual characters exhibited by migratory male salmon, such as the hooked snout and humped back, no morphological characters other than body size contributed to the reproductive success of masu salmon parr. This non-contribution may have been responsible for the lack of development of sexual characters in precocious males.},

  abstract = {Identification of the amount of lake trout spawning habitat and its actual use by lake trout in Lake Ontario is important for re-establishment of this species. From a combination of hydrographic field data, bathymetry measurements, and video observations, 20 reputed spawning sites, 14 of which were considered to be historically important, were evaluated for possible use by lake trout. Based on preliminary evaluations 13 of the 20 sites were rejected for further study because of inappropriate substrate or excessive infilling of interstitial spaces. Additional, more intense evaluations were made of seven sites, five that were of historical importance and two that were man-made. These seven sites had areas of suitable spawning habitat of from 6 to 4,000 m2, minimal water depths of from 2.2 to 10.8 m, mean cobble diameters of 9.8{\textendash}20.0 cm, and slopes of 20{\textendash}45{\textdegree}. Lake trout egg densities, estimated from recoveries in egg nets deployed in 1992, ranged from a mean of 6 to 6,200 eggs m-2 and the highest densities were found at man-made sites. The actual egg deposition on the seven sites studied intensely amounted to only 0.0003 to 0.6\% of the potential deposition if all the lake trout that survived from stocking within a 30 km radius of each site spawned there.

Egg survival to the eyed stage ranged from 21 to 82\% and was inversely related to wind fetch. Spawning was earlier in western than in eastern Lake Ontario and was related to the rates of fall cooling. Duration of the spawning period ranged from 1 to 39 days but the low estimates were from collections of only a few eggs. A swim-up mortality syndrome observed in eggs reared in a laboratory was high, ranging from 31.0 to 74.5\%. The potential for lake trout restoration in Lake Ontario appears to be limited by a scarcity of good spawning sites, low egg deposition on spawning sites recognized by researchers, and excessive swim-up mortality.},

Survival to hatch was significantly higher in the laboratories and averaged 80.9\%. In Lake Superior, egg survival among incubators at all sites was significantly higher (P \&lt; 0.0001) for incubators that remained buried in spawning substrates (15.1{\textendash}21.0\%) than for incubators that were partially or completely exposed to water currents (1.0{\textendash}12.6\%).

Egg survival among incubators that remained buried at the deep (14.4\%) and shallow-water sites (21.0\%) on Gull Island Shoal was not significantly different. Because incubators that were completely buried or partially exposed only appeared to differ in their degree of exposure, we concluded that survival of eggs in the lake was reduced by mechanical stress associated with water turbulence. Lower egg survival at Gull Island Shoal, a known lake trout-spawning site, was not expected and appeared to have been caused by a strong gale that occurred when these eggs were in late epiboly, a sensitive embryological stage. We present a hypothesis suggesting that lake trout recruitment in the Great Lakes is limited by availability of spawning habitat.},

  abstract = {We experimentally tested the behavioral response of native lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) to the loss of spawning habitat in a 67 ha lake. In the first year, two of the historically utilized spawning sites (15 \% of the historic spawning habitat) were covered to prevent spawning fish from using the sites. Lake trout responded by selecting 12 new sites around the lake. In the second year, when an additional 35 \% of the historic spawning habitat was removed, the density of eggs deposited at the remaining traditional site increased and 8 more new sites were selected. These manipulations produced no detectable change in the timing of spawning and fish appeared to rapidly abandon efforts to use the former sites. This study demonstrates that lake trout will actively seek out alternate spawning sites when traditional habitat is lost. Initial indications are that useable spawning habitat is not limited in Whitepine Lake, but the long-term effects of the selection of alternative sites are not yet known.},

  abstract = {Conventional sex roles imply caring females and competitive males. The evolution of sex role divergence is widely attributed to anisogamy initiating a self-reinforcing process. The initial asymmetry in pre-mating parental investment (eggs vs. sperm) is assumed to promote even greater divergence in post-mating parental investment (parental care). But do we really understand the process? Trivers {[}Sexual Selection and the Descent of Man 1871{\textendash}1971 (1972), Aldine Press, Chicago] introduced two arguments with a female and male perspective on whether to care for offspring that try to link pre-mating and post-mating investment. Here we review their merits and subsequent theoretical developments. The first argument is that females are more committed than males to providing care because they stand to lose a greater initial investment. This, however, commits the `Concorde Fallacy' as optimal decisions should depend on future pay-offs not past costs. Although the argument can be rephrased in terms of residual reproductive value when past investment affects future pay-offs, it remains weak. The factors likely to change future pay-offs seem to work against females providing more care than males. The second argument takes the reasonable premise that anisogamy produces a male-biased operational sex ratio (OSR) leading to males competing for mates. Male care is then predicted to be less likely to evolve as it consumes resources that could otherwise be used to increase competitiveness. However, given each offspring has precisely two genetic parents (the Fisher condition), a biased OSR generates frequency-dependent selection, analogous to Fisherian sex ratio selection, that favours increased parental investment by whichever sex faces more intense competition. Sex role divergence is therefore still an evolutionary conundrum. Here we review some possible solutions. Factors that promote conventional sex roles are sexual selection on males (but non-random variance in male mating success must be high to override the Fisher condition), loss of paternity because of female multiple mating or group spawning and patterns of mortality that generate female-biased adult sex ratios (ASR). We present an integrative model that shows how these factors interact to generate sex roles. We emphasize the need to distinguish between the ASR and the operational sex ratio (OSR). If mortality is higher when caring than competing this diminishes the likelihood of sex role divergence because this strongly limits the mating success of the earlier deserting sex. We illustrate this in a model where a change in relative mortality rates while caring and competing generates a shift from a mammalian type breeding system (female-only care, male-biased OSR and female-biased ASR) to an avian type system (biparental care and a male-biased OSR and ASR).},

  abstract = {Abstract The selective pressures involved in the evolution of semelparity and its associated life-history traits are largely unknown. We used species-level analyses, independent contrasts, and reconstruction of ancestral states to study the evolution of body length, fecundity, egg weight, gonadosomatic index, and parity (semelparity vs. degree of iteroparity) in females of 12 species of salmonid fishes. According to both species-level analysis and independent contrasts analysis, body length was positively correlated with fecundity, egg weight, and gonadosomatic index, and semelparous species exhibited a significantly steeper slope for the regression of egg weight on body length than did iteroparous species. Percent repeat breeding (degree of iteroparity) was negatively correlated with gonadosomatic index using independent contrasts analysis. Semelparous species had significantly larger eggs by species-level analysis, and the egg weight contrast for the branch on which semelparity was inferred to have originated was significantly larger than the other egg weight contrasts, corresponding to a remarkable increase in egg weight. Reconstruction of ancestral states showed that egg weight and body length apparently increased with the origin of semelparity, but fecundity and gonadosomatic index remained more or less constant or decreased. Thus, the strong evolutionary linkages between body size, fecundity, and gonadosomatic index were broken during the transition from iteroparity to semelparity. These findings suggest that long-distance migrations, which increase adult mortality between breeding episodes, may have been necessary for the origin of semelparity in Pacific salmon, but that increased egg weight, leading to increased juvenile survivorship, was crucial in driving the transition. Our analyses support the life-history hypotheses that a lower degree of repeat breeding is linked to higher reproductive investment per breeding episode, and that semelparity evolves under a combination of relatively high juvenile survivorship and relatively low adult survivorship.},

  abstract = {Many fish populations have both resident and migratory individuals. Migrants usually grow larger and have higher reproductive potential but lower survival than resident conspecifics. The `decision' about migration versus residence probably depends on the individual growth rate, or a physiological process like metabolic rate which is correlated with growth rate. Fish usually mature as their somatic growth levels off, where energetic costs of maintenance approach energetic intake. After maturation, growth also stagnates because of resource allocation to reproduction. Instead of maturation, however, fish may move to an alternative feeding habitat and their fitness may thereby be increased. When doing so, maturity is usually delayed, either to the new asymptotic length, or sooner, if that gives higher expected fitness. Females often dominate among migrants and males among residents. The reason is probably that females maximize their fitness by growing larger, because their reproductive success generally increases exponentially with body size. Males, on the other hand, may maximize fitness by alternative life histories, e.g. fighting versus sneaking, as in many salmonid species where small residents are the sneakers and large migrants the fighters. Partial migration appears to be partly developmental, depending on environmental conditions, and partly genetic, inherited as a quantitative trait influenced by a number of genes.},

Field studies of capped natural redds have related survival to conditions in the redds or surrounding areas but not demonstrably in egg pockets. These data probably do not accurately reflect conditions faced by embryos or emerging alevins. The few data on egg pocket characteristics indicate that geometric mean particle diameter, fredle index, and permeability are higher in gravel surrounding the embryos than elsewhere, Survival to alevin emergence usually regresses positively on each of these factors separately and on dissolved oxygen in intragravel water. Survival to emergence usually relates negatively to percentages of small fines. Quantitative predictors depend upon careful definition of egg pocket structure through field surveying of egg pocket centrum locations and on intensive study of pocket conditions. Laboratory duplication of egg pocket structure and physical variables will permit more accurate modeling of effects of fines on survival to emergence. Redd capping in natural redds can provide estimates of survival to emergence, which one may relate to average egg pocket conditions and to variates in the redd. After appropriate modeling, it may become possible to relate conditions outside of the egg pocket to the environment within it and to survival-to-emergence.},

Weather conditions may influence the time and duration of the reproductive period but it most often occurs in the last half of October and lasts about 10 days. Water surface temperatures are usually between 50 and 55{\textdegree}F. Spawning occurs chiefly at night from sunset to about 10:30 p. m. Nightly counts were made of the fish on the beds during spawning in Lake Louisa in 1947. Courtship behaviour is described. Males made up 60{\textendash}85 percent of the spawning population. The size composition of the spawning population varied markedly from lake to lake because of different growth rates. The smaller trout spawn first. Egg frequency estimates on the spawning beds averaged 50 per square foot. Saprolegnia infection of the eggs on the beds appears to be the main cause of egg mortality. Northern brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus) and Menominee whitefish (Prosopium cylindraceum quadrilaterale) were the chief egg predators. Water level drawdowns in late fall and winter may expose some eggs and make large areas of potential beds unavailable for spawning. Time of hatching ranges from mid-February to late March, an incubation period of 15 to 21 weeks. The fry leave the spawning beds by at least mid-May.},

Small dialysis chambers were placed in cobble-gravel substrates, at sites used by spawning lake trout. These were filled with nitrogen-purged distilled water and were allowed to equilibrate with substrate water at depths of about 4{\textendash}8 cm below sediment surface. Open boxes of artificial substrate (0.25 m2) were placed flush with this surface to collect bedload and deposited fines. Recoveries were made at 1-to 2-week intervals throughout the fall. In two Algonquin lakes where lake trout reproduction is successful, DO concentrations were mostly \&gt; 5 mg L-1, dissolved CO2 was generally \&lt;6 mg L-1, and non-ionized ammonia was negligible. At sites in eastern Lake Ontario, there were great differences in water quality depending upon proximity to weed beds and local wind/wave conditions. Low DO (\&lt;0.5 mg L-1) and relatively high non-ionized ammonia (\&gt;30 \ensuremath{\mu}g L-1) were associated with degradation of milfoil and, to a lesser extent, Cladophora. In the Finger Lakes, substrate quality was much lower in Seneca Lake (hatchery supported lake trout stock) than in Keuka Lake (wild lake trout stock). Depression of DO followed periods of high paniculate flux and this stress was greatest after lake trout spawning, and when rates of degradation are still relatively high.},

  abstract = {Abstract The principal spawning grounds of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush namaycush) in United States waters of southern Lake Superior are on rocky shoals at depths of less than 20 fathoms. Most spawning occurs in October and early November. Of the mature fish collected on or near the spawning grounds, 60 to 69 percent were males. Among mature fish the average length of females was greater than that of males; few males less than 24 inches or females less than 26 inches in total length were caught. Recoveries of lake trout tagged on the spawning grounds showed that some males remained in the immediate area for a period of several weeks during the spawning season. Marked fish showed a tendency to return during later years to spawning grounds on which they had been tagged, even though many of them ranged long distances between spawning seasons. The percentage of the total weight composed by gonads of maturing females collected in 1950 was 5.0 percent on August 11{\textendash}30 and 12.3 percent on October 6{\textendash}9, but this increase was not accompanied by an increase in the coefficient of condition. One volumetric and two gravimetric methods for estimating numbers of eggs in ovaries were evaluated. Some advantage in accuracy of estimate resulted from the drying of eggs in an oven before weighing on an analytical balance. Production of eggs by 70 lake trout ranging from 25.1 to 38.0 inches in total length and from 5.8 to 19.6 pounds in weight ranged from 2,476 to 17,119. Average production was 646 per pound of fish; this number was greater among fish 31.0 inches long or larger than for fish of smaller size. Thirteen fish identified by commercial fishermen as siscowets (Salvelinus namaycush siscowet) also showed extensive individual variation in numbers of eggs, although egg production tended to increase with increasing length and weight of the fish. A mature female siscowet as small as 16.5 inches long and a 15.7-inch mature male were collected about 45 miles north of Grand Marais, Michigan. Combined data from all collections showed that spawning of lake trout or siscowets may occur during at least 6 months of the year (June to November).},

  abstract = {Recent observations of spawning lake trout Salvelinus namaycush near Drummond Island in northern Lake Huron indicate that lake trout use drumlins, landforms created in subglacial environments by the action of ice sheets, as a primary spawning habitat. From these observations, we generated a hypothesis that may in part explain locations chosen by lake trout for spawning. Most salmonines spawn in streams where they rely on streamflows to sort and clean sediments to create good spawning habitat. Flows sufficient to sort larger sediment sizes are generally lacking in lakes, but some glacial bedforms contain large pockets of sorted sediments that can provide the interstitial spaces necessary for lake trout egg incubation, particularly if these bedforms are situated such that lake currents can penetrate these sediments. We hypothesize that sediment inclusions from glacial scavenging and sediment sorting that occurred during the creation of bedforms such as drumlins, end moraines, and eskers create suitable conditions for lake trout egg incubation, particularly where these bedforms interact with lake currents to remove fine sediments. Further, these bedforms may provide high-quality lake trout spawning habitat at many locations in the Great Lakes and may be especially important along the southern edge of the range of the species. A better understanding of the role of glacially-derived bedforms in the creation of lake trout spawning habitat may help develop powerful predictors of lake trout spawning locations, provide insight into the evolution of unique spawning behaviors by lake trout, and aid in lake trout restoration in the Great Lakes.},

They explore the functioning of Boreal Shield ecosystems, focusing on the lake trout, the classic coldwater species of northern glaciated lakes, using it as an indicator of environmental change and as a model to measure the effectiveness of management actions. This book demonstrates how boreal waters have served as a crucible for decades of environmental research into the impacts of nutrient additions, trace contaminants, acid rain, climate change, sport fishing, invasive species, and watershed disturbances.The text builds on this substantial research legacy and explores our ability to manage human interactions with ecosystems across the vast Boreal Shield ecozone of North America, and with other important ecosystems worldwide. It also provides models and new methods of assessing the risk to and the durability of ecosystems in relation to local, regional, and global human activities. Maps and descriptions of several important long-term monitoring sites and an atlas describing more than 3,000 lake trout lakes in the region are special components of the book.},

  abstract = {A field study on current structure and circulation characteristics in Lake Vendyurskoe, a small, shallow, icecovered lake in Karelia, Russia, is presented. The current velocity magnitudes were generally found to be small. The most pronounced currents had an oscillating character, with velocity amplitudes on the order of millimeters per second. The oscillation period, obtained from spectral density calculations, corresponded to that of a barotropic uninodal seiche. The seichelike nature of the current oscillations was supported by the results from analysis of icelevel fluctuations, giving identical periods and a phase shift of one-fourth the period between the two types of oscillations. Mean currents measured during the winter were on the order of millimeters per second. Because Lake Vendyurskoe does not have any significant river inflow or outflow during winter, the most probable cause of these currents is horizontal temperature (pressure) gradients. Scaling analysis indicated that these currents are geostrophic. This was supported by theoretical estimates, based on observed horizontal temperature gradients, being of the same order as the observed currents. The mean current velocities increased considerably after spring convection from \ensuremath{<}1 to several millimeters per second.},

  abstract = {Natural recruitment from hatchery-origin lake trout in the Great Lakes has been minimal, except in Lake Superior and a few limited areas in Lake Huron. Quantitative studies of survival between egg deposition and fry emergence were conducted on a spawning reef in the eastern basin of Lake Ontario to determine variables associated with poor reproduction of hatchery-origin lake trout. Thirty to 90 mesh bags were buried in the substrate of Stony Island Reef in 1990, 1991, and 1992 to collect eggs and fry. Bags were retrieved on three dates over the six month period between the end of spawning and fry emergence. Mean egg abundance in the substrate increased significantly (P \&lt; 0.01) from 700 m-2 in 1990 to 3,572 m-2 in 1991 and 3,355 m-2 in 1992. Change in egg abundance probably resulted from an increase in the proportion of Seneca strain spawners, rather than an increase in the total number of adults in the eastern basin. Mean embryo survival from spawning to late November or early December was 45\% (range, 27{\textendash}57\%), approximately 7.5\% (range, 7.4{\textendash}7.5\%) to mid{\textendash}April, and about 3\% (range, 1.8{\textendash}3.9\%) to the time of emergence in mid-May. Much of the early mortality of fertilized eggs was probably due to physical shock caused by water currents during storms. Mortality later in development was caused by predation and possibly poor incubation quality of substrate along the base of the reef due to sedimentation. A life history model for lake trout in Lake Ontario was developed and parameters set with the levels of fertilization and egg-to-fry survival rate estimated in this study. Other parameters were estimated from stocking rates and previous studies. Model output indicated that the current lake trout population has the potential to produce over 1.2 million age-1 fish annually. No evidence exists for this level of recruitment in Lake Ontario. Natural recruitment may be limited by a low proportion of eggs incubating in suitable substrate and/or low survival of fry to age-1. These problems could be due to a combination of 1) a limited amount of spawning habitat, 2) ineptitude of some strains to locate or recognize spawning habitat, 3) disease-related mortality during the swim-up life stage, and 4) mortality from fish predation shortly after swim-up. Managers need to reconsider current strategies and time requirements necessary to achieve restoration goals and objectives for lake trout in Lake Ontario.},

  abstract = {Shape is a fundamental property of all objects, including sedimentary particles, but it remains one of the most difficult to characterize and quantify for all but the simplest of shapes. Despite a large literature on the subject, there remains widespread confusion regarding the meaning and relative value of different measures of particle shape. This paper re-examines the basic concepts of particle shape and suggests a number of new and modified methods which are widely applicable to a range of sedimentological problems; it is shown that the most important aspects of particle form are represented by the I/L ratio (elongation ratio) and S/I ratio (flatness ratio). A combination of these two ratios can be used to classify particles in terms of 25 form classes. A method of obtaining a quantitative measure of particle roundness using simple image analysis software is described, and a new visual roundness comparator is presented. It is recommended that measurements of both roundness and circularity (a proxy measure of sphericity) are made on grain images in three orthogonal orientations and average values calculated for each particle. A further shape property, irregularity, is defined and a classification scheme proposed for use in describing and comparing irregular or branching sedimentary particles such as chert and coral.},

  abstract = {A one-dimensional thermodynamic model for simulating lake-ice phenology is presented and evaluated. The model can be driven with observed daily or hourly atmospheric forcing of air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, cloud amount and snowfall. In addition to computing the energy balance components, key model output includes the temperature profile at an arbitrary number of levels within the ice/snow (or the water temperature if there is no ice) and ice thickness (clear ice and snow-ice) on a daily basis, as well as freeze-up and break-up dates. The lake-ice model is used to simulate ice-growth processes on shallow lakes in arctic, sub-arctic, and high-boreal forest environments. Model output is compared with field and remote sensing observations gathered over several ice seasons. Simulated ice thickness, including snow-ice formation, compares favourably with field measurements. Ice-on and ice-off dates are also well simulated when compared with field and satellite observations, with a mean absolute difference of 2 days. Model simulations and observations illustrate the key role that snow cover plays on the seasonal evolution of ice thickness and the timing of spring break-up. It is also shown that lake morphometry, depth in particular, is a determinant of ice-off dates for shallow lakes at high latitudes. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2003 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Mainly from studies in Swedish lakes, current velocities and mixing coefficients are quantified for the different processes generating water movement. Seiche movement caused by wind induced oscillations of the ice cover is found to be most efficient for the horizontal mixing giving coefficients of the order 100 cm2 s-1. The lateral dispersion in through-flow currents can be determined using standard formulas, but the dispersion coefficient is 1{\textendash}2 orders of magnitude less than that for oscillation induced mixing. Convective mixing due to heat flow from the sediments lasts through the winter but is a very slow process. Convection caused by penetration of solar radiation is more effective, but this process is usually of importance only during the last month prior to break-up of the ice-cover.},

  abstract = {A two-dimensional vertically averaged flow model was applied to study the circulation patterns in Lake Belau (Northern Germany). The lake is north{\textendash}south oriented, with a maximum extension of 2.2 km and is situated in a dead ice hole with steep slopes on the east and west coasts. A part of the coastal area is covered with forest, creating a strong shelter from prevailing south-westerly winds. The system of shallow water equations is discretized with the modified Utnes (1990) scheme which is characterized by a semi-decoupling algorithm. The continuity equation is rearranged to Helmholtz equation form. The upwinding Tabata (1977) method is used to approximate convective terms. Extensive wind (more than 60 observations) and current measurements (5 points) conducted all over the lake enabled us to verify the simulation results with observations. Under spatially homogeneous wind conditions the model predicts a two cell circulation system, that covers most part of the lake. Taking the spatial variation of wind speed due to shelter into account, the flow field changes drastically. The two cell system is replaced by one large cell, with a strong reverse jet along the western shore. The sheltering effect of the surrounding hills and vegetation have a pronounced effect on the circulation pattern. It appears that in general this fact cannot be neglected in numerical lake flow simulations.},

Over the last 40 years, \ensuremath{>}90\% of populations in the Snake River basin became more synchronized with one another. However, over that period, sockeye populations from Alaska did not exhibit systemic changes in synchrony. Coincident with increasing Snake River population synchrony, there was an increase in hatchery propagation and the number of large dams, potentially homogenizing habitats and populations. A simulation using economic portfolio theory revealed that synchronization of Snake River salmon decreased risk-adjusted portfolio performance (the ratio of portfolio productivity to variance) and decreased benefits of population richness. Improving portfolio performance for exploited species, especially given future environmental change, requires protecting a diverse range of populations and the varied habitats upon which they depend.},

  abstract = {Penetration of solar radiation through ice and snow covering northern lakes produces a gravity current between regions with varying depths. This baroclinic current is a dominant physical process in winter because ice cover insulates lakes from the usual turbulence sources such as breaking surface waves and near-surface shear produced by the wind. The current forms a directed circulation from the littoral zone to the centre of the lake that is an important distribution mechanism for nutrients and other chemical and biological constituents. Heat transported by the current degrades the ice cover and makes surface travel hazardous. The thinning of the ice cover is most severe at the inlet to isolated bays with mean depths that differ significantly from the lake. At the mouth of a bay, the gravity current takes the form of a two-layer flow with inflow to the bay occurring near the surface. The lower layer has the largest temperature gradients and is dominated by a succession of progressive internal bores which decrease in amplitude overnight and with increasing cloud cover. The repetition of the bores occurs very close to the period of the uninodal barotropic seiche which suggests that the internal bores are forced by the surface seiche.},

  abstract = {Abstract:\hspace{0.6em} The effects of water level fluctuations on fish and other aquatic biota, with an emphasis on winter water withdrawal in northern regions is reviewed. Water demands for population growth and development are adding pressure on water reserves, particularly when coupled with changing climatic conditions. Water level fluctuations can have adverse effects on the environment, most notably to hydrologic and biotic processes ranging in magnitude from the micro-scale to landscape level. Water level management of lakes and reservoirs can affect all forms of aquatic biota. The severity of effect is dependant on the magnitude, duration and timing of the fluctuation, and the species exposed. In northwestern Canada and northern Alaska, water is withdrawn from water bodies to construct ice-roads and other winter based developments. Biota in small, isolated water bodies are particularly sensitive to reductions in winter water levels. Water withdrawals can reduce the oxygen available to overwintering fish, while reduced water levels can reduce habitat for fish and furbearers, and freeze littoral areas killing plants, invertebrates, and fish eggs. Regulatory winter water withdrawal thresholds have been developed in the Northwest Territories and Alaska and continue to be refined as new data becomes available. The use of thresholds can help minimize or avoid negative impacts to the environment, particularly fish, from winter water withdrawal activities. Many different factors may influence the effect that winter water withdrawal has on a water body, such as basin shape, substrate and location. More research is warranted to better understand the linkages between anthropogenic and natural water level fluctuations and their combined effect on aquatic ecosystems. A general decision support system is proposed for minimizing risk to aquatic life from winter water withdrawal activities.},

  abstract = {Determining the habitat use and movements by fish is critical to our understanding of aquatic ecosystem function. The objective of this study was to assess the diel movements of Burbot (Lota lota) over the open water season. We employed a high-resolution acoustic telemetry positioning system to track the movements and activity of four Burbot during the ice-free season (between June and September) in a sub-Arctic lake. Burbot underwent diel bank migration (DBM), a benthic form of diel vertical migration, where depths are transitioned in close association with the bottom rather than through the water column. During daytime, Burbot occupied deeper water, at the transition of soft, low complexity substrates and ascended along the rocky bottom lake banks to shallower water habitats at night. Increased activity rates during shallow water forays suggest active feeding events. DBM was low at the start of summer with nearly 24 h of daylight, but increased towards the mid-summer with a more pronounced night cycle, coalescing towards the fall. The DBM of Burbot is dynamic, with proximate triggers of light and temperature, and ultimate causes likely being foraging opportunities, bioenergetics gain and predator avoidance.},

  abstract = {Spawning behavior of lake trout, Salvelinus namaycush, is poorly understood, relative to stream-dwelling salmonines. Underwater video records of spawning in a recovering population from the Drummond Island Refuge (Lake Huron) represent the first reported direct observations of lake trout spawning in the Laurentian Great Lakes. These observations provide new insight into lake trout spawning behavior and expand the current conceptual model. Lake trout spawning consisted of at least four distinct behaviors: hovering, traveling, sinking, and gamete release. Hovering is a new courtship behavior that has not been previously described. The apparent concentration of hovering near the margin of the spawning grounds suggests that courtship and mate selection might be isolated from the spawning act (i.e., traveling, sinking, and gamete release). Moreover, we interpret jockeying for position displayed by males during traveling as a unique form of male-male competition that likely evolved in concert with the switch from redd-building to itinerant spawning in lake trout. Unlike previous models, which suggested that intra-sexual competition and mate selection do not occur in lake trout, our model includes both and is therefore consistent with evolutionary theory, given that the sex ratio on spawning grounds is skewed heavily towards males. The model presented in this paper is intended as a working hypothesis, and further revision may become necessary as we gain a more complete understanding of lake trout spawning behavior.},

  abstract = {In systems with multiple piscivores, co-occurrence is dependent on resource partitioning. This is pronounced in oligotrophic northern lakes, which have simple food webs and short open-water seasons. We used acoustic telemetry and stable isotopes to quantify habitat and dietary partitioning during thermal stratification among three piscivores that commonly co-occur in Canadian sub-Arctic lakes{\textemdash}burbot (Lota lota), lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), and northern pike (Esox lucius). Spatial core areas and core habitat niches (space and depth) did not significantly overlap among species. Although burbot and lake trout occupied similar mean daily depths (16.2 m and 13.4 m, respectively), and water temperatures (5.4 {\textdegree}C and 6.9 {\textdegree}C, respectively), they were spatially segregated. Burbot were closely associated with the lake bottom on steep drop-offs between the offshore and nearshore zone with moderate substrate complexity, whereas lake trout were located over deep offshore basins and suspended above the lake bottom. Northern pike occupied shallow depths (5.3 m) and warmer water (16.5 {\textdegree}C) within the nearshore region and were closely associated with bottom substrate of highest complexity. Some significant overlap among spatial home ranges and broad habitat niches indicated that these species interact. However, dietary niches did not significantly overlap at either the core or broad levels, suggesting that species were utilizing spatially diverse food sources. Our results highlight the importance of including depth and space when quantifying resource partitioning among fishes and provide insight into the mechanisms that promote piscivore co-occurrence in northern lakes.},

Males and females preferred male and juvenile stimuli over no stimuli, but only had weak preferences for female stimuli.

  abstract = {. Factors associated with the evolution of sexual dimorphism in sockeye salmon were examined by relating individual behavioural correlates of reproductive success with morphological measurements in both sexes. Adult salmon were captured, measured and tagged, then released and observed in Iliamna Lake, Alaska. Males were generally larger than females (447 versus 428 mm) and had larger dorsal humps and more elongated jaws for their length. Indices of male reproductive success varied considerably among individuals (e.g. 0-12 observations in dominant status). Male social status was positively associated with both length and dorsal hump size, independent of length. All resident females completed spawning and only nine of 82 had their nests dug up by other females. However, size-related variation in spawning-site location was observed; larger females tended to spawn in shallower water than did smaller females. Thus reproductive success apparently varied much more in males than in females. Consistent with the theory regarding the evolution of sexual dimorphism, the greater variability in male reproduction was directly associated with the greater average size and exaggerated shape of males.},

Because these hypotheses differ in their relevance across oviparous taxa, each hypothesis must be tested to ensure accurate understanding of the ultimate reason behind oviposition-site choice in a particular taxon. By presenting the major hypotheses for oviposition-site choice as they relate to diverse oviparous animals, we nonetheless illustrate particular trends across animal taxa, while highlighting avenues for future research into the ecological and evolutionary drivers of oviposition-site choice.},

  abstract = {Clustering algorithms are attractive for the task of class identification in spatial databases. However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large databases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solution to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an appropriate value for it. We performed an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 benchmark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLAR-ANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by a factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency.},

  abstract = {In most animals, members of one sex compete more intensely for mates than members of the other sex, and show a greater development of secondary sexual traits. The relative intensity of mating competition in the two sexes depends on the operational sex ratio (OSR) (the ratio of males that are ready to mate to females that are ready to mate) at the site and times when mating occurs. The extent and direction of biases in the OSR is closely related to the potential rates of reproduction that individual males and females can achieve, although the distribution of the two sexes in space and time, sex differences in development time or life expectancy, and biases in the sex ratio at birth or hatching can also be important. The potential rates of reproduction in the two sexes are, in turn, affected by the proportion of time and energy expended by male and female parents on their progeny, though other factors may constrain reproductive rate in one or both sexes. We outline a simple model of the factors affecting the OSR, where relative parental expenditure by the two sexes and the adult sex ratio are fixed, and a more complex model where the adult sex ratio varies in relation to the reproductive activity of the two sexes. This framework for relating sex differences in mating competition to the OSR, potential reproductive rates, and parental expenditure differs from Triver's concept of the relation between parental investment and mating competition in three ways: first, it identifies the OSR as the immediate factor determining which sex completes most intensely for mates; second, it recognizes that factors other than the future fitness costs of rearing offspring can affect the potential reproductive rate of the two sexes; third, it suggests an empirical measure (potential reproductive rate) that can be estimated in natural populations and used to predict the distribution of mating competition.},

  abstract = {The influence of sperm competition and individual mating behaviour in an externally fertilizing species of fish, the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), is estimated from video observations of multiple-male spawnings and subsequent paternity analyses. One male dominated the paternity during polygamous spawnings, fathering more than 80\% of the progeny in a single nest. Behavioural analyses of the spawnings showed that the first-mating male had sperm precedence in 6 out of 10 cases. In three of the other spawnings, sperm limitation likely influenced individual success, as the first-mating male had participated in a large number of spawnings. In the final, nearly simultaneous spawning, male size was more important than the 0.6-s difference in spawning times. Thus, male fertilization success can be influenced by a variety of factors, including sperm precedence, male size, and spawning history., L'influence de la comp{\'e}tition pour le sperme et du comportement copulateur individuel chez une esp{\`e}ce {\`a} f{\'e}condation externe, le Saumon de l'Atlantique (Salmo salar), a {\'e}t{\'e} estim{\'e}e par l'enregistrement vid{\'e}o de frayes impliquant plusieurs m{\^a}les et par des analyses de paternit{\'e}.

  abstract = {Canada's Northwest Territories (NWT) is currently the focus of significant exploration and development activity. In particular, increased global demand for oil and gas resources has resulted in an escalation in the search for hydrocarbon deposits. Canada's north is a landscape defined by water where large numbers of pristine water bodies still exist in remote areas. Northern development activities conducted in these areas will affect these sensitive aquatic ecosystems that support important fish and fish habitat. Fishes in low productivity northern systems grow slowly and mature late, making them particularly sensitive to environmental perturbations. The fishery resources of the NWT are an integral component of our northern ecosystems, and are of significant economic and cultural importance to northern people. By necessity, linear developments constructed in the NWT, such as roads, seismic lines, and pipelines, intersect lakes, rivers, and streams. This paper discusses linear development activities and th..., Les Territoires du Nord-Ouest (TNO) au Canada font pr{\'e}sentement l'objet d'importantes activit{\'e}s d'exploration et de d{\'e}veloppement.
